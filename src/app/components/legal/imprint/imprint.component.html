          <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The contents of our website have been created with the greatest
            possible care. However, we cannot guarantee the contents' accuracy,
            completeness, or topicality. According to Section 7, paragraph 1 of
            the TMG (Telemediengesetz - German Telemedia Act), we as service
            providers are liable for our content on these pages by general laws.
            However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we service
            providers are not obliged to monitor external information
            transmitted or stored or investigate circumstances pointing to
            illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
            information under general laws remain unaffected. However, a
            liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of
            knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such
            violations, we will remove the content immediately.
          </p>

          <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents
            we have no control. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for
            these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
            websites is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.
            The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the
            time of linking. Illegal contents were not identified at the time of
            linking. However, permanent monitoring of the contents of the linked
            pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation.
            Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links
            immediately.
          </p>

          <h2>Copyright</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The contents and works on these pages created by the site operator
            are subject to German copyright law. The duplication, processing,
            distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of
            copyright require the written consent of the respective author or
            creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for
            private, non-commercial use. In so far as the contents on this site
            were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties
            are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such.
            Should you become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform
            us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such
            contents immediately.
